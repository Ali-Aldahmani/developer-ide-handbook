## About This Guide

This guide is based on **practical experience and real workflows**.  
Every IDE here is something I’ve personally used, tested, or observed in real projects.

> Tip from experience: "A good IDE can save you hours a week, but the wrong setup can cost days."

# Architecture Models

## 1 Extension-Based Systems

Lightweight core + plugin ecosystem.  

**Examples:** Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text  

**Why I like it:**  
- VS Code: my go-to for web experiments and Python scripts. I often combine it with R extensions for hybrid projects.  
- Sublime: when I just need to quickly open a file, review logs, or make tiny edits — nothing beats the speed.

**Best Use Case:** Flexible projects, experimental workflows, or multi-language environments.

---

## 2 Fully Integrated Systems

Built-in toolchains designed for deep language support.

**Examples:** IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, Rider, CLion, Visual Studio, Xcode, RStudio  

**Why they’re great:**  
- PyCharm: my favorite for ML pipelines — virtual environments and Jupyter notebooks are handled effortlessly.  
- IntelliJ: for large-scale Java backend projects, it saves hours on refactoring.  
- RStudio: perfect for statistical workflows — plotting, packages, R Markdown — all in one place.  

**Best Use Case:** Enterprise projects, production code, professional workflows.
